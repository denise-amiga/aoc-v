Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on Mastodon and
@ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: Never Tell Me The Odds ---</h2><p>It seems like something is going wrong with the snow-making process. Instead of forming snow, the water that's been absorbed into the air seems to be forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail" target="_blank">hail</a>!</p>
<p>Maybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?</p>
<p>Due to strong, probably-magical winds, the hailstones are all flying through the air in perfectly linear trajectories. You make a note of each hailstone's <em>position</em> and <em>velocity</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>
<pre><code>19, 13, 30 @ -2,  1, -2
18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3
</code></pre>
<p>Each line of text corresponds to the position and velocity of a single hailstone. The positions indicate where the hailstones are <em>right now</em> (at time <code>0</code>). The velocities are constant and indicate exactly how far each hailstone will move in <em>one nanosecond</em>.</p>
<p>Each line of text uses the format <code>px py pz @ vx vy vz</code>. For instance, the hailstone specified by <code>20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3</code> has initial X position <code>20</code>, Y position <code>19</code>, Z position <code>15</code>, X velocity <code>1</code>, Y velocity <code>-5</code>, and Z velocity <code>-3</code>. After one nanosecond, the hailstone would be at <code>21, 14, 12</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you won't have to do anything. How likely are the hailstones to collide with each other and smash into tiny ice crystals?</p>
<p>To estimate this, consider only the X and Y axes; <em>ignore the Z axis</em>. Looking <em>forward in time</em>, how many of the hailstones' <em>paths</em> will intersect within a test area? (The hailstones themselves don't have to collide, just test for intersections between the paths they will trace.)</p>
<p>In this example, look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least <code>7</code> and at most <code>27</code>; in your actual data, you'll need to check a much larger test area. Comparing all pairs of hailstones' future paths produces the following results:</p>
<pre><code>Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstones' paths will cross <em>inside</em> the test area (at x=14.333, y=15.333).

Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstones' paths will cross <em>inside</em> the test area (at x=11.667, y=16.667).

Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=6.2, y=19.4).

Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for hailstone A.

Hailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstones' paths are parallel; they never intersect.

Hailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=-6, y=-5).

Hailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for both hailstones.

Hailstone A: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=-2, y=3).

Hailstone A: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for hailstone B.

Hailstone A: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for both hailstones.
</code></pre>
<p>So, in this example, <code><em>2</em></code> hailstones' future paths cross inside the boundaries of the test area.</p>
<p>However, you'll need to search a much larger test area if you want to see if any hailstones might collide. Look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least <code>200000000000000</code> and at most <code>400000000000000</code>. Disregard the Z axis entirely.</p>
<p>Considering only the X and Y axes, check all pairs of hailstones' future paths for intersections. <em>How many of these intersections occur within the test area?</em></p>
